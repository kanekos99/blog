description: Just a quick update on what I've been doing for the past month - aka the time I suddenly got really into game dev...? 
---

So... I kind of gave up updating this blog (and my entire website tbh) for a month because I was a little busy with some other projects. But I guess it's never too late for an update :D

Around the end of last December, I started learning Godot for fun and I got really into game dev for a bit. I ended up making this little prototype game thingy?

It is honestly more of an art demo than a game since the only thing you can do is to walk around in a tiny area and have one dialogue with another character, but I made all of the assets in this scene, which I'm pretty proud of.

I might make a more detailed post about it later, but you can check out the recording of the demo on [my Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/DS4-JNWEYwl/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link).

After this point, I got a little intimidated by the scope of what I wanted for this game (it's intended to be an action rpg of sorts?), so I decided to work on something a little simpler first by joining a game jam.

I ended up finding [this visual novel game jam](https://itch.io/jam/swakjam-2026) on itch.io, and spent the entirety of January working on my submission for it.

I will definitely make a more detailed post about it, but for now, you can check out my entry [here](https://kanekos99.itch.io/how-not-to-kill-a-vampire-lord)!

It's a pretty silly story about a vampire butler trying to kill the vampire lord that he serves, but do read the content warnings before playing since there are some darker themes.

Around the time I was wrapping up my VN development, Arknights: Endfield came out and that became a pretty big distraction as well. 

I feel obliged to glaze this game since it is the only gacha that has actually given me the standard character that I want on my beginner banner pulls:

But it is really very fun and I love factory building!!!!!!

And that is pretty much how the past two months have been for me. 

It feels a little odd not have a big project to work on anymore, although I did want to take some time to rest and recharge. Except my brain won't let me and now I'm constantly coming up with new game/ story ideas that may or may not go anywhere, which is the last thing I need when I already have so many uncompleted projects...

Anyway, I am starting small again with simple things like updating my website. (I really need to get rid of the Christmas theme aksjhad like okay maybe Feburary is too early for Christmas!!)

Also I'm trying deploying to neocities via a github action because one of the reasons I lowkey gave up updating this blog is that it was really inconvenient to have to reupload the whole blog dist folder each time. 

I followed [this guide](https://localghost.dev/blog/how-i-deploy-my-eleventy-site-to-neocities/) and it was pretty easy to set-up. But back up your site before you try this I guess!!
