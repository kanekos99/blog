description: A log of my attempt at Petrapixel's Advent Calendar of Digital Challenges, compiling challenges from Day 1 to 7.
---

[This advent calendar challenge](https://petrapixel.neocities.org/fun/advent-calendar-2025) looked interesting, so I thought I'd give it a try. However, instead of doing each challenge daily, like how you are supposed to, I've decided to do the challenges weekly. As in, I will do one week's worth of challenges in one shot at the end of the week. Is that cheating? Probably, yeah, but I don't have the time to attempt the challenges during week days.

Also in the interest of time, I probably won't be attempting the additional challenges on the list, unless there is one that I really like.

### 🎁 Day 1 - Time for a repaint <a name="day-1"></a>

<details class="challenge-box">
    <summary>
        <b>Challenge</b>
    </summary>
    <i>Let's start easy: Time for a new lockscreen and wallpaper for all of your devices. Maybe even something seasonal?
    </br></br>
    Bonus challenge for tryhards & go-getters:
    </br></br>
    (For PC users.) Ever tried to use custom folder icons for your folders? You can find some on deviantart for example. Personally I love these. It's a really neat way of sprucing up your files! Installation is easy: just right-click the folder and choose a new image for the icon.</i>

First up is my phone lockscreen wallpaper. The source of the original art is [HazoZOYAKU](https://x.com/HazoZOYAKU) on Twitter, featuring Phainon from Honkai Star Rail, and I still really want to keep it as my lockscreen, so I did a very silly festive edit of it on Canva.

Next, we have my homescreen wallpaper. The old one is an edit I made from [this art](https://x.com/mewki14/status/1681913026025500672) of a chibi Dan Heng by [mewki14](https://x.com/mewki14) on Twitter. The new one is taken from [this art](https://x.com/kaokitty1223/status/1868265656929636747) by [kaokitty1223](https://x.com/kaokitty1223) on Twitter, featuring kitty Dr Ratio and Aventurine.

{% imgBlock "/posts/images/advent_calendar/home_wallpaper.png", "Art Source: [mewki14](https://x.com/mewki14/status/1681913026025500672) and [kaokitty1223](https://x.com/kaokitty1223/status/1868265656929636747)" %}

I'm not sure if I'm fully satisfied with the new one, so I might change it up again after Christmas.

Finally, there is my desktop wallpaper that I've been using since Chinese New Year. This gorgeous art of Dan Heng is done by [原汁云喵-mao](https://x.com/32OOOO/status/1756033603459563880) on Twitter.

{% imgBlock "/posts/images/advent_calendar/desktop_wallpaper_old.png", "[Art Source](https://x.com/32OOOO/status/1756033603459563880)" %}

For the new one, I picked this beautiful piece featuring Phainon by [当雨作金泽](https://weibo.com/2017504782/Pzdieezpo) on Weibo:

_(Yes, I exclusively choose to use wallpapers of whoever my favourite characters are at the moment.)_

Technically I have an iPad too, but since I rarely look its home screen and lock screen, I'm not going to change it this time.

### 🎁 Day 2 - YouTube Declutter <a name="day-2"></a>

<details class="challenge-box">
    <summary>
        <b>Challenge</b>
    </summary>
    <i>Continuing with simple challenges: Today, unsubscribe from all the YouTube channels you're not interested anymore! Your subscription box will thank you
    </br></br>
    Bonus challenge for tryhards & go-getters:
    </br></br>
    Sort and declutter your YouTube playlists. And if you have videos of your own, private or delete them if you don't need them anymore.</i>
</details>
<br>

To be honest, I pretty much never check my subscription box anymore, so this probably didn't make much of a difference. But I cleaned out some channels that I didn't care for anymore, and also some channels that I don't even remember subscribing to. I did keep my subscriptions to some inactive channels for nostalgia's sake, and also just to keep track of them.

Instead of discussing the channels that I've unsubscribed from and potentially enraging their fans, I'll make this section a list of Youtubers that I still enjoy watching:

▶️[Dan and Phil](https://www.youtube.com/@DanAndPhil) --- If you've been on Youtube, you've probably heard of them...? 😂 I have been casually watching their videos for a really long time now, and while I'm not super involved in the fandom, I was _shook_ when they did their [reveal video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxe_YMJ4nUs).

▶️[Jenny Nicholson](https://www.youtube.com/@JennyNicholson) --- I don't really know if she'll post on Youtube anymore but I'll forever be obsessed with her [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4AdFD3E2ok) on the Vampire Diaries because I loved that series when I was younger, so it was hilarious to watch someone tear it to pieces (not even in a mean way). She also has a way of keeping you captivated while talking about some of the most random and obscure topics.

▶️[Jazza](https://www.youtube.com/@Jazza) --- I subscribed to him in the past for his character design videos, but recently I was super impressed that he managed to write a whole book in such a short period of time.

▶️[ActuallyRea](https://www.youtube.com/@ActuallyRea) --- Love their sketchbook videos and their art style in general!

▶️[DoodleDate](https://www.youtube.com/@DoodleDate) --- Very cosy art videos, I like to watch them in the background sometimes when drawing.

▶️[LetsGameItOut](https://www.youtube.com/@LetsGameItOut) --- He does Let's Plays in which he destroys the game.

▶️[Liam Thompson](https://www.youtube.com/@LiamThompsonOfficial) --- I found him from a video in which he taught his dog how to play Minecraft, but since then his videos have improved _a lot_ in terms of storytelling and production quality, although he doesn't post that much anymore.

▶️[Max0r](https://www.youtube.com/@Max0r) --- I subscribed to him for his iconic "bad" video game summaries but he also does some crazy edits. All my knowledge of Metal Gear Rising come from his videos.

▶️[CodeBullet](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeBullet) --- He makes funny (and occasionally educational) coding projects.

▶️[Danidev](https://www.youtube.com/@Danidev) --- I don't know if he still posts on Youtube anymore but I love his game dev videos.

There are many other Youtubers that I like but I think that's enough for this post.
