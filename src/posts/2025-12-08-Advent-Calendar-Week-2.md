description: A log of my attempt at Petrapixel's Advent Calendar of Digital Challenges, compiling challenges from Day 8 to 15.
---

The second week of me attempting [Petrapixel's Advent Calendar of Digital Challenges](https://petrapixel.neocities.org/fun/advent-calendar-2025)! As mentioned in my post for [Week 1](/blog/posts/2025-12-06-Advent-Calendar-Week-1/), I'm going to do these challenges weekly instead of daily. While I might get the time to attempt them on some week days, I'll still be keeping my posts about them to once a week.

### 🎁 Day 8 - Small Circle <a name="day-8"></a>

<details class="challenge-box">
    <summary>
        <b>Challenge</b>
    </summary>
    <i>If you're currently following more than 50 people on a social media (e.g. instagram, twitter, ...), reduce it to 50. If you're following less than 50 already, reduce it to 25. Focus on what/who you really care about, and get rid of the rest. You'll love it, I swear.
    </br></br>
    Bonus challenge for tryhards & go-getters:
    </br></br>
   Reset your instagram explore page/suggestions so that they are not interesting to you anymore. (This can be done in the settings.)</i>
</details>
<br>

I picked my private Twitter account for this, since I follow the most amount of random people on this account, whereas on my Instagram and public Twitter, I'm mostly following mutuals or friends.

The downside of this is that I am following 398 people on this Twitter account, so there is no way I can possibly get it down to 50. Still, I thought I'd give it a shot and clean out the accounts that I'm no longer interested in.

Aaaand... 

We're down to 374 accounts.

Look I really tried my best 😂 But my Twitter following list has pretty much become a time capsule of my interests, so I couldn't bring myself to unfollow a lot of old accounts that I have fond memories of, even if they are inactive or I'm not actively involved in the fandom anymore.

### 🎁 Day 9 - E-Books <a name="day-9"></a>

<details class="challenge-box">
    <summary>
        <b>Challenge</b>
    </summary>
    <i>If you have e-books, it's now time to sort them - on your PC or e-reader or whatever. I highly recommend the free software Calibri for e-book management.
    </br></br>
    Bonus challenge for tryhards & go-getters:
    </br></br>
   Download new e-books free & legally from Project Gutenberg. It's a treasure trove.</i>
</details>
<br>

The closest thing I have to an e-reader is the Books app on my iPhone. In which I have a grand total of 23 books. I guess I can still try to sort them:

### 🎁 Day 10 - Passwords <a name="day-10"></a>

<details class="challenge-box">
    <summary>
        <b>Passwords</b>
    </summary>
    <i>Enter your email address into Have I Been Pwned to see if your email was ever in a data breach.
    </br></br>
    Bonus challenge for tryhards & go-getters:
    </br></br>
   Change your passwords. Yes, all of them. Or at least a few.
</i>
</details>
<br>

Ngl if I hadn't heard of this site before, I'd be a little more cautious about entering my email into a random website.

{% imgBlock "/posts/images/advent_calendar/pwned_site.png", "" %}

Well, thanks Wattpad. I don't even remember signing up for an account with this email.

### 🎁 Day 11 - Privacy <a name="day-11"></a>

<details class="challenge-box">
    <summary>
        <b>Privacy</b>
    </summary>
    <i>Make your social media accounts private. That means instagram, twitter, etc.
    </br></br>
    Bonus challenge for tryhards & go-getters:
    </br></br>
   Block people you are jealous of, don't like or for some other reason don't want to see posts of.
</i>
</details>
<br>

Unfortunately I do need to use Instagram for posting my art, so I'll be skipping this challenge. I do have some private accounts for posting photos and the like but all of my public facing accounts are for art exclusively.

### 🎁 Day 12 - Browser Switch <a name="day-12"></a>

<details class="challenge-box">
    <summary>
        <b>Browser Switch</b>
    </summary>
    <i>If you're currently using Google Chrome, well... Let's not, okay? Switch to another browser, I recommend Firefox.
    </br></br>
    Bonus challenge for tryhards & go-getters:
    </br></br>
   Let's try to get away from Google even more: Replace google.com with another search engine like DuckDuckGo or Ecosia.
</i>
</details>
<br>
Downloaded Firefox to give it a try. Now I just have to figure out how to make it CORS-disabled.

### 🎁 Day 13 - Phone Declutter <a name="day-13"></a>

<details class="challenge-box">
    <summary>
        <b>Phone Declutter</b>
    </summary>
    <i>Sort through your phone gallery and other files on your phones, and make sure you delete everything you don't need.
    </br></br>
    Bonus challenge for tryhards & go-getters:
    </br></br>
   Use your phone's settings or a space-saver app to detect which files/apps use the most space on your phone, and make space accordingly.
</i>
</details>
<br>

I deleted some random images from my phone gallery, but I still need to find some time to upload my most recent travel photos to cloud before I can remove them.
