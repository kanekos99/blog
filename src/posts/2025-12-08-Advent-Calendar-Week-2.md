description: A log of my attempt at Petrapixel's Advent Calendar of Digital Challenges, compiling challenges from Day 8 to 15.

The second week of me attempting [Petrapixel's Advent Calendar of Digital Challenges](https://petrapixel.neocities.org/fun/advent-calendar-2025)! As mentioned in my post for [Week 1](/blog/posts/2025-12-06-Advent-Calendar-Week-1/), I'm going to do these challenges weekly instead of daily. I might get the time to attempt them throughout the week, but I'll still be keeping my posts about them to once a week.

    <i>If you're currently following more than 50 people on a social media (e.g. instagram, twitter, ...), reduce it to 50. If you're following less than 50 already, reduce it to 25. Focus on what/who you really care about, and get rid of the rest. You'll love it, I swear.

    Bonus challenge for tryhards & go-getters:

   Reset your instagram explore page/suggestions so that they are not interesting to you anymore. (This can be done in the settings.)</i>

I picked my private Twitter account for this, since I follow the most amount of random people on this account, whereas on my Instagram and public Twitter, I'm mostly following mutuals or friends.

The downside of this is that I am following 398 people on this Twitter account, so there is no way I can possibly get it down to 50. Still, I'll give it a shot and clean out the accounts that I'm no longer interested in.

Aaaand... 

We're down to 374 accounts.

Look I really tried my best 😂 But my Twitter following list has pretty much become a time capsule of my interests, so I couldn't bring myself to unfollow a lot of old accounts that I have fond memories of, even if they are inactive or I'm not actively involved in the fandom anymore.
