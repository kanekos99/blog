Hello and welcome to my blog! 
<br>
<br>
So why did I make a blog? Well, I mostly to see if I could code one from scratch myself and hopefully learn how to use a new front end framework in the process. I've always hated installing node modules, so as far as possible, I've kept to using vanilla Javascript or whatever libraries that I could get through a CDN. Sorry if my coding practices are extremely questionable. But that all changes with this blog! Yay! (Not really, please don't look at the source code for this, it is still really bad.)
<br>
<br>
This blog was built using [**eleventy**](https://www.11ty.dev/) with the help of many tutorials that I will link in a separate resources post. The process was a little easier than I thought it would be, and somehow, kind of fun? In the same way that running a marathon might be fun, maybe. For some people. Not me though. I would rather code a blog from scratch than run a marathon.
